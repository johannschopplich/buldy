# Buldy
If [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) and [CodyHouse's framework](https://github.com/CodyHouse/codyhouse-framework) would have children: This is one of them. Built using the best of both worlds this minimal css framework is a suitable companion and starter point for small web projects as well as big design systems.

The framework serves the following purposes:

1. **Base** — Only most important styles for a general project boilerplate are included.
2. **Responsive and fluid** – Through carefully crafted scaling factors across spacing and typography rules.
3. **Design system** - It simplifies the process of creating the base of your design system.

## What's included
- A reset built on top of Bootstrap's [`reboot.scss`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_reboot.scss), Jeremy Thomas' (creator of Bulma) [`minireset.sass`](https://github.com/jgthms/minireset.css/blob/master/minireset.css) and [`modern-normalize.css`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize/blob/master/modern-normalize.css)
- Color (primary, accent, light and dark theme color variations), spacing and component **variables**
- Container, hero and section classes
- A content class based on Bulma's approach
- Minimal grid – heavily inspired by Bulma's
- Basic button styling
- Essential helpers

## How did we get here
Well, yet another framework which seeks to be used? Yes. I used Bulma and Bootstrap heavily over the years — Bulma's class naming syntax was a breeze to work with, although I preferred Bootstraps grid breakpoints. I often found myself removing unwanted stuff from every big framework I worked with (Bulma came as close as it can probably get to be the perfect allrounder).

One influental dev once said that every programmer should develop his own framework. I guess he's right as this is my try. I wanted to use a framework which only includes the essentials a project needs. Everything else should be added per project. Thoroughly searching the interweb didn't brought me closer to what I wished to find.

Then Codyhouse came along and presented the world with a series of articles and shortly after published their own framework:
- Part 1: [Typography](https://medium.com/codyhouse/create-your-design-system-part-1-typography-7c630d9092bd)
- Part 2: [Grid & Layout](https://medium.com/codyhouse/create-your-design-system-part-2-grid-layout-aa961d59b8d6)
- Part 3: [Colors](https://medium.com/codyhouse/create-your-design-system-part-3-colors-798e4729921f)
- Part 4: [Spacing](https://medium.com/codyhouse/create-your-design-system-part-4-spacing-895c9213e2b9)
- Part 5: [Icons](https://medium.com/codyhouse/create-your-design-system-part-5-icons-594f39cfb1b)
- Part 6: [Buttons](https://medium.com/codyhouse/create-your-design-system-part-6-buttons-58e2eda2173e)

The use of CSS Custom Properties for a framework blew my mind. But again, some design choices incorporated into the framework weren't my taste. So I used their great ideas and created my own framework.

Improvements and suggestions are always welcome.
